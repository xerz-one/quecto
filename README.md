# Quecto
A Linux distribution aimed at being as tiny as possible.

## Goals
- Live ISO for read-only and read-write media
- Supports i686 systems, either BIOS or UEFI
- Old school desktop environment
    - CDE is currently the window manager of choice
- Features Firefox and a terminal emulator
    - Might end up adding something else, a drawing app or something
- Optimized as much as reasonable
    - Targeting Pentium III for minimum system requirements
    - Should be able to fit within a 140MB MD Data
